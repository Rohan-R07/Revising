# Revsing

## 📱 About the Application

This is a small Android app built using Jetpack Compose.  
It includes examples of:

- `LazyColumn`
- `Dialog`
- `ScaffoldState`
- And more UI essentials

This app is primarily meant for **revision purposes** — after taking a long break from previous work, I'm using this to refresh my Compose skills.  
It could also be useful for **beginners** looking to learn basic Compose components through a practical example.
