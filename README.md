# 📘 Revsing — UI Practice App (Jetpack Compose)

**Revsing** is a small Jetpack Compose-based Android application created to help revise and reinforce core UI concepts after a break from development. It includes practical use of essential components like:

- 🧾 **LazyColumn**
- 🪟 **Dialogs**
- 🎛 **Scaffold with Snackbar & Drawer state**
- 🎨 **Custom UI elements**
- ⚡ **Basic Compose animations**

This app is not feature-heavy — its purpose is purely educational. It's designed as a **refresher project** for yourself and a **learning reference** for beginners looking to understand how common Jetpack Compose components work together in a simple UI.

The structure and clean use of Compose APIs can help new developers get started and also assist returning developers in quickly revisiting the modern Android UI toolkit.
